-----------------------------------------------Hooks--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hooks are functions that let you “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from function components. Hooks don't work inside classes — they let you use React without classes.
Hooks allow function components to have access to state and other React features. Because of this, class components are generally no longer needed. Although Hooks generally replace class components, there are no plans to remove classes from React.
