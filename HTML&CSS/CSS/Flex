Flex -

The flex container becomes flexible by setting the display property to flex:

The flex container properties are:

flex-direction
flex-wrap
flex-flow
justify-content
align-items
align-content

flex-direction :- row; (Default value of flex-direction is row, justify-content : X axis, align-items : Y axis)
                  column;
                  row-reverse;
                  column-reverse; 

flex-wrap :- wrap; (Default value of flex-direction is no-wrap) 
             wrap-reverse; 

This is a shorthand for flex-direction: and flex-wrap: 
flex-flow: row-reverse wrap;  

justify-content will justify the content in horizontal direction (for default row)
justify-content :- flex-start; 
                   flex-end; 
                   center; 
                   space-between; 
                   space-evenly; 
                   space-around; 

align-items will justify the content in vertical direction (for default row)
align-items :- center; 
               flex-end; 
               flex-start; 
               stretch/normal; 
               start; 
               end; 
               baseline; 

The flex item properties are :-

order
flex-grow
flex-shrink
flex-basis
flex
align-self

order :-  Higher the order, later it shows up in the container.

flex-grow :- This property specifies how much a flex item will grow relative to the rest of the flex items.


flex-basis :- The flex-basis Property specifies the initial length of a flex item.

Example :- 
Set the initial length of the third flex item to 200 pixels:

<div class="flex-container">
  <div>1</div>
  <div>2</div>
  <div style="flex-basis: 200px">3</div>
  <div>4</div>
</div>


flex :- The flex property is a shorthand property for the flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis properties.

Example
Make the third flex item not growable (0), not shrinkable (0), and with an initial length of 200 pixels:

<div class="flex-container">
  <div>1</div>
  <div>2</div>
  <div style="flex: 0 0 200px">3</div>
  <div>4</div>
</div>

align-self :- flex-start;
              flex-end;
              center;  
              stretch;
              baseline;


Note 1 :-
when we set flex-wrap
Items are wrapping in one or more rows
align-items come to picture and they work on cross axis
Values - flex-start flex-end space-around space-between space-evenly

Note 2 :-
If you want to override the width, set flex-basis - it helps to define an items size differently.
flex-basis: 0 - size of maximum shrink

Note 3 :-
The gap property is then used to specify the gap between the flex items. In this code, gap:40px 20px sets the gap to 40 pixels vertically and 20 pixels horizontally. This means that there will be a 40-pixel gap between each row of flex items, and a 20-pixel gap between each column of flex items.
