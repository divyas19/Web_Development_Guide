Positions -

Absolute : Makes element out of normal flow.
           To make it move in coordination with some other element, give that parent element some position apart from static.   

Static : Default
         No access to Top Right Bottom Left and Z-Index unlike relative

Relative : An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.
           Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.

Fixed : An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the element.
        A fixed element does not leave a gap in the page where it would normally have been located.

Sticky : Give it top offest , (Before it behaves relative) as the distance from top is that offset it sticks behaving as sticky.
